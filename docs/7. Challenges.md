# Challenges

Now that we've built the basic site, there might be time for some challenges! Below are a list of feature ideas that take advantage of other ASP.NET Core features:

## Identity
 - Add local user accounts using ASP.NET Core Identity instead of Google or Twitter authentication - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity

## Logging
- Add `Serilog`, a 3rd party logger to the front end and disable built in console logging.
- Add `ILogger` support to the front end `ApiClient` implementation to log all outgoing http requests.

## Images
 - Allow attendees to upload images.
 - Resize the image using [ImageSharp](https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp)

## Caching
 - Add appropriate caching to FrontEnd site:
    - [Memory cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/memory)
    - [Distributed cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed)
    - [Response caching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/response)

## Tag Helpers
- Render Markdown for the session Abstract (instead of HTML) using a custom markdown tag helper.

## Data
 - Change database provider to [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) - https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql/
 - Change database provider to [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/) - https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data/
 
## Testing
 - Write unit tests for the BackEnd Controllers
 - Write unit tests for the FrontEnd Razor pages

## FrontEnd Features
- Make the names slugs instead of using IDs in the urls to navigate entities
- Support multiple conferences
   - Add conference date
   - Make the home page show upcoming conferences (within 5 days)
   - Move agenda to separate page
- Add admin pages to manage:
  - Tracks
  - Attendees
  - Conferences
  - Sessions
  - Speakers (allow speaker image upload)
  
## BackEnd Features
 - Add date filtering to the BackEnd APIs
 - Add support for returning XML from the APIs
 - Add links to related entities in the responses e.g. Attendee has a list of sessions, return URLs for each of the session resources related to Attendee.
