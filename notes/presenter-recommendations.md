  * Use Student Name Placards
    * Have the students write their name on a folded piece of paper which they can prop up on their desk 
    * Calling on students by name is huge in building rapport and ensuring their involvement
  * Student Introductions
    * Easy to do with a small group like we had (obviously wouldn’t work with 100 participants)
    * This teaches us each participant’s background to better cater the content to them
    * Helps the instructors make a personal connection with the attendees & build rapport
  * Spend longer explaining the code
    * After having the students copy/paste code, walk through each line explaining what it does and how it works
    * Many times, we copy/pasted code and were told on a high-level what it does, but we didn’t explain the “how”
      * I learned that this method did X, but I didn’t understand how the method did X
  * Avoid “Teacher-to-Teacher Banter”
    * It’s alienating to the students when teachers talk amongst each other
      * The students don’t know the teachers’ inside jokes, making it awkward for us just sitting there and listening 
      * There was also a few times that you discussed a technical topic amongst each other that I was interested in, but I wasn’t “a part of the conversation” and I felt like I couldn’t jump in / comment / question.
    * Instead, direct jokes / questions / comments towards the students 
      * This ensures that the students are always a part of the conversation
      * Allows the students to respond and ask questions or add comments
      * Also builds rapport between the teachers & students
