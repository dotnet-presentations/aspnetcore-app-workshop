Given that, Rust is gaining popularity in the area of systems programming \u2013 but it is not limited to that. Rust is a great choice for application development, too. You can use it to build blazingly fast web APIs in the cloud or enhance web apps using WebAssembly. In this talk, Rainer Stropek, founder of the Rust Linz Meetup, will talk about the reasons for his excitement for Rust. You will hear about some unique properties of the language and its related tooling that distinguishes Rust from other programming platforms. If you have not found the time to look into Rust but you are curious about it, this is the session for you."

The components run natively in the .NET process and render web UI to an embedded web view control using a local interop channel.\r\n\r\nThis hybrid approach gives you the best of native and the web. Your components can access native functionality through the .NET platform, and they render standard web UI. .NET MAUI Blazor apps can run anywhere .NET MAUI can (Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android)."

This improves the ecosystem during your regular course of work for the mutual benefit of the community. When you fix open-source issues, you\u2019re removing a bug from the world for everyone, and others will do the same for you. This can be applied to internal teams being open-source within your company; even if your company doesn\u0027t permit external contributions, consider how an open-source mindset can help improve cross-team collaboration and velocity. Fix issues faster by submitting a patch instead of creating a ticket.

Not that it has to potential to save lives; it is already saving lives and has been for years.  From cancer research to medical diagnosis to safety and security to covid-19 detection and everything in between; AI is saving lives. \r\n\r\nYet we have technology industry pillars like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, leaders AI, who\u2019s revenue, and consequently shareholder value is rooted in internet advertising.  Companies who are using AI to track your activities on the internet to detailed granularity which produces influenceable advertising that is simply scary.

All a hacker now needs to get your data is a service on Azure and a leaked password.\r\nOver the last year there were quite a few features released in Azure that help us prevent this. In this session, I will show you how you can add additional security layers using virtual networks, Azure Private Link, Service endpoints, VPN connections, and more. For all of these services, I will tell you how to get started and what limitations you can expect.

When should you combine multiple entity types in a single container? Should you de-normalize your entities? What\u2019s the best partition key for your data?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we discuss the key strategies for modeling and partitioning data effectively in Cosmos DB. Using a real-world NoSQL example based on the AdventureWorks relational database, we explore key Cosmos DB concepts\u2014request units (RUs), partitioning, and data modeling\u2014and how their understanding guides the path to a data model that yields the best performance and scalability. Attend this session, and acquire the critical skills you\u2019ll need to design the optimal database for Cosmos DB."

    "Description": "MOV is an assignment instruction in the assembly language. C# supports async and await pattern by rewriting method into a state machine. Domain specific languages give us languages tuned for some domain problems. Lambda Calculus shows how to calculate things using functions only. These things are completely different! Or are they?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will go through abstraction and why it is important to extract common patterns into specific solutions. We will understand why we need multiple programming languages and cannot just have \u0022one language to suit everyone\u0022. We will see basics of async/await, Lambda Calculus and DSL. We will then discuss some ideas behind theory of computations to see why we don\u0027t need to have anything beside MOV. Finally, we will see why we build tools and abstractions to deliver customer value."

    "Description": "Three seconds. When a user arrives at a Power BI report, that\u2019s how long you have to seize their attention with the most critical facts. As they mouse-over the report, they search for their most important categories and trends, then their details-on-demand\u2026 do they quickly find answers to their questions, or do they drown in the data of yet another report? The answer isn\u2019t solely determined by elegant and performant visuals or deep AI and analytics; Power BI developers need to first know their users, then design a holistically effective, logical user experience. This experience, known as the Information-Seeking Mantra \u2013 or the 3/30/300 rule - leverages visual best practices to split the report into three parts: The information gained by the user in (A) three seconds, (B) thirty seconds and (C) three hundred seconds. In the deeper layers, interactivity in Power BI enables powerful, self-driven question-and-answer data exploration. Effectively combining both these visual and functional elements in a user-oriented way can lead to powerhouse reporting that can revolutionize a workplace. With these reports, Business users can test their ideas and questions to get reliable answers, and, more importantly, use them to drive actions to get the desired results.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explain three principles we employ in an effort to design quality, usable Power BI reports that allow business users to quickly answer both basic and complex questions in an action-oriented way. We see these principles as valuable best practice guidelines for (1) co-creating reports with users, as well as (2) visual and (3) functional guidelines for design. For (1), we will illustrate our typical approach to user-oriented design using examples. For (2), we will illustrate key data visualization principles and demonstrate how they are typically executed when designing a report in Power BI using the default visualization types. For (3) we will demonstrate our experience with effectively leveraging powerful interactions in Power BI like drillthrough, graphical tooltips, page navigation, dynamic measure \u0026 dimension selection, and more. In addition, (2) \u2013 (3) will include short technical \u0027recipes\u0027 on how to these can be implemented by yourself. Finally, we will put it all together with an example that we hope highlights how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. By the end of the talk, we hope you will understand this approach to design, and the value it can provide in designing useful Power BI reports. \r\n"

Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) provides developers with the capability to provision learning environments equipped with these high-end GPU cards with prices starting at $0.18 per hour. This enables anyone with an Azure subscription and a curious mind to experiment with advanced image to image transfer with generative adversarial networks.\r\nIn this demo-intensive session Alan will explain the theory of generative adversarial networks and describe how they can be trained in image transfer scenarios. He will then demonstrate how Azure ML can be leveraged as a platform for training complex GANs by running the Everybody Dance Now source code as an Azure ML experiment. The transfer of motion between a test subject and a real dancer will be demonstrated and explained along with tips for generating more accurate results.

These are universal design principles, and Juval will use examples from software and non-software systems alike. You will also see how to overcome the real hurdles architects face pursuing volatility-based decomposing, simple and practical techniques for identifying areas of volatility, and common telltale signs or \u0022smells\u0022 when your design is still functional. Juval Lowy has helped hundreds of companies apply successfully these ideas, and he has transformed the lives of countless of architects. "

    "Description": "If you ever wanted to see how language features get implemented in the C# compiler and language services, then this talk is for you. Come and join us for a rollercoaster ride in the Roslyn compiler source code, implementing a small language feature in 60 minutes, starting from \u0022git clone\u0022, building Roslyn, implementing our feature, compiling the compiler, and finally compiling a little snippet of code using our new language feature using our custom compiler build. During this talk, we\u0027ll encounter syntax trees, semantic analysis, bound trees, and more."
